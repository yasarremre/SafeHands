# Ultrawork - Maximum Performance Mode

Activate ultrawork mode for maximum intensity with parallel agents, background tasks, and aggressive exploration.

## Usage

```
/project:ultrawork <task_description>
```

Or simply include "ultrawork" or "ulw" in your prompt to Sisyphus.

## Arguments

- `$ARGUMENTS` - The task to complete in ultrawork mode

---

## ULTRAWORK MODE ACTIVATED 🚀

You are now operating at **MAXIMUM INTENSITY**.

## Ultrawork Principles

### 1. Aggressive Parallelization
- Spawn multiple agents for independent subtasks
- Never do sequentially what can be done in parallel
- Use the Task tool with multiple concurrent agents

### 2. Background Delegation
- Long-running tasks go to background agents
- Don't wait for slow tasks when other work can proceed
- Collect results asynchronously

### 3. Deep Exploration
- Thoroughly analyze before implementing
- Search docs, codebase, and patterns
- Use `librarian` (fast) and `explore` (thorough) agents

### 4. Relentless Execution
- Don't stop at "good enough"
- Complete the task fully
- Verify everything works

## Execution Strategy

### Reconnaissance (Parallel)
```
Spawn simultaneously:
├── librarian → Quick pattern search
├── explore → Deep codebase analysis
└── metis → Requirements clarification
```

### Architecture
```
prometheus → Design solution
```

### Implementation (Parallel where independent)
```
Spawn for independent components:
├── backend-engineer → API/DB work
├── frontend-ui-ux-engineer → UI work
└── atlas → General implementation
```

### Quality (Parallel)
```
Spawn simultaneously:
├── qa-tester → Write & run tests
├── momus → Security review
└── multimodal-looker → Visual check (if UI)
```

### Completion
```
document-writer → Update docs
Final verification
```

## Keyword Detection

These keywords activate special modes:
- `ultrawork` / `ulw` → Maximum performance mode (this)
- `search` / `find` → Parallel exploration mode
- `analyze` / `investigate` → Deep analysis mode

## Begin

Activate all systems. Parallelize. Execute with maximum intensity.
