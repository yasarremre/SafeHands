# Ultrawork Loop - Maximum Intensity Ralph Loop

Ralph Loop with **ULTRAWORK MODE** active - maximum intensity with parallel agents, background tasks, and aggressive exploration.

## Usage

```
/project:ulw-loop <task_description>
```

## Arguments

- `$ARGUMENTS` - The task description and completion criteria

---

You are now entering an **ULTRAWORK LOOP** - a Ralph Loop with maximum intensity.

## ULTRAWORK MODE ACTIVATED

In this mode, you MUST:

1. **Aggressive Parallelization**: Spawn multiple subagents for independent tasks
2. **Background Tasks**: Delegate long-running tasks to background agents
3. **Deep Exploration**: Thoroughly analyze codebase, docs, and patterns
4. **Relentless Execution**: Don't stop until the task is verifiably complete

## Your Task

$ARGUMENTS

## Ultrawork Strategy

### Phase 1: Reconnaissance (Parallel)
Spawn these agents simultaneously:
- `librarian` - Search for relevant patterns and implementations
- `explore` - Map the codebase structure and dependencies
- `metis` - Identify best practices and requirements

### Phase 2: Architecture
- `prometheus` - Design the solution architecture
- Create a detailed implementation plan

### Phase 3: Implementation (Parallel where possible)
- `backend-engineer` / `frontend-ui-ux-engineer` / `atlas` - Implement features
- Work on independent components in parallel

### Phase 4: Quality (Parallel)
- `qa-tester` - Write and run tests
- `momus` - Security and code review
- `multimodal-looker` - Visual verification (if UI)

### Phase 5: Completion
- `document-writer` - Update documentation
- Final verification

## Iteration Rules

After each iteration:
- If task is FULLY COMPLETE: `<promise>COMPLETE</promise>`
- If progress made but not done: `<continue>NEXT_ITERATION</continue>`
- If blocked: `<blocked>REASON</blocked>`

## Ultrawork Principles

1. **Never sequential when parallel is possible**
2. **Delegate aggressively to specialized agents**
3. **Verify everything with tests**
4. **Don't stop at "good enough" - achieve complete**

## Begin

Activate ultrawork mode. Analyze, parallelize, and execute with maximum intensity.
